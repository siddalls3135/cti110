# This program calculates distance and time problems

# Sets the speed at 70
speed = 70
#lets the program know what DistanceAfter6 is
distanceAfter6 = 6

#lets the program know what DistanceAfter10 is
distanceAfter10 = 10

#lets the program know what DistanceAfter15 is
distanceAfter15 = 15

# Tells the program to print how far the car will travel in 6 hours by multiplying speed * distanceAfter6 and print miles after the number
print('after 6 hours the car will travel ' + str((speed * distanceAfter6)) + (" miles"))

# Tells the program to print how far the car will travel in 10 hours by multiplying speed * distanceAfter10 and print miles after the number
print('after 10 hours the car will travel ' + str((speed * distanceAfter10)) + (" miles"))

# Tells the program to print how far the car will travel in 15 hours by multiplying speed * distanceAfter15 and print miles after the number
print('after 15 hours the car will travel ' + str((speed * distanceAfter15)) + (" miles"))
